* make a list of hacks to port over
* check symbols
* helpers for test context
* drag offsets and alignments
* missing examples: images, nodes as drag previews
* separate stress tests from normal examples
* conflicting backends: must be a nicer solution.
* make sure missing methods are OK
* make sure we don't screw server rendering (NoopBackend?)
* export methods for verifying validness from dnd-core
* early invariants for common mistakes (e.g. missing context?)
* fix hot reloading
* higher-level components
* change sortable example to avoid indexOf
* try fun sCU optimizations with monitor

dnd-core
* smarter canDrop()
* state extractor on removed target
* OKAY we prob need this big optimization: materialized views. (stream of props) + (stream of actions)
