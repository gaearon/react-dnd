* make a list of hacks to port over
* check symbols
* helpers for test context
* conflicting backends: must be a nicer solution.
* make sure we don't screw server rendering (NoopBackend?)
* export methods for verifying validness from dnd-core
* early invariants for common mistakes (e.g. missing context?)
* fix hot reloading
* higher-level components

* change drop() to always work with object, remove didDrop
* change beginDrag() to accept an array and transform value, symmetric to drop()
* this should make HTML5#handleTopDragStart shorter and loopless
* add support for drag effect
* add support for alignments and implement them

* example: image as drag preview (what do we do about DragImagePreloader?)
* example: advanced communication (different effects, drop results, overriding parent drop zones)
