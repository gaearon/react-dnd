* make a list of hacks to port over
* check symbols
* helpers for test context
* drag offsets and alignments
* missing examples: images, nodes as drag previews
* separate stress tests from normal examples
* conflicting backends: must be a nicer solution.
* make sure missing methods are OK
* make sure we don't screw server rendering (NoopBackend?)
* export methods for verifying validness from dnd-core
* make perf (shouldComponentUpdate) configurable
* early invariants for common mistakes (e.g. missing context?)

dnd-core
* smarter canDrop()
* state extractor on removed target
