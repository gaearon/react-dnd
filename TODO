* make a list of hacks to port over
* check symbols
* helpers for test context
* conflicting backends: must be a nicer solution.
* make sure we don't screw server rendering (NoopBackend?)
* export methods for verifying validness from dnd-core
* early invariants for common mistakes (e.g. missing context?)
* fix hot reloading
* higher-level components
* what do we do about DragImagePreloader?

* change drop() to always work with object, remove didDrop
* should we allow gif drag previews? see: safari
* setDragImage and IE

* don't use react internals.

* example: advanced communication (drop results, overriding parent drop zones)
